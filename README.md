# vibrant-interface
A resource pack that brings Minecraftâ€™s interfaces to life by adding vibrant, unique textures to each menu and container.

The resource pack is based on discontinued versions by Chris_XENO and BurntToast__ under the name Colourful Containers.

My version differs from these in that I have added new textures for the menus and UI, given every texture an Ore-UI-like style and changed every container to a greater or lesser extent. Most of the animations have been adopted from the original versions.
